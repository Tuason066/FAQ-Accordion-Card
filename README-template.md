### What I learned

So, I just use bootstrap for the first time with this project and I have difficulty using it, especially in detailed design (illustration part) because of the difficulty that I encountered I knew how bootstrap flow and where I can use it to build a responsive web design. I knew that bootstrap can't be used all the time and there's a lot of realization I have been. Before, I thought if you use bootstrap you don't need to write your own CSS style but it is not. 

### Continued development

This is also my first project for my vanilla javascript without following any tutorial. This is my first step to master my vanilla javascript skills and proceed to react but before that also I want to take the frontend mentor challenges FREE (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) Challenge.
